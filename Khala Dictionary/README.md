# Subquery project Khala Dictionary
####  Khala Network tackles the issue of trust in the computation cloud.\n\nThis blockchain is a trustless computation platform that enables massive cloud processing without sacrificing data confidentiality. Built around TEE-based privacy technology already embedded into modern processors, Khala Networkâ€™s distributed computing cloud is versatile and confidential. By separating the consensus mechanism from computation, Khala ensures processing power is highly scalable. Together, this creates the infrastructure for a powerful, secure, and scalable trustless computing cloud.
