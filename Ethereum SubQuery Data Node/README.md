# Subquery project Ethereum SubQuery Data Node
####  # Introduction
**SubQuery Data Node** is an enhanced Ethereum node with extra subql_ rpcs.

These rpcs are optimised for querying, similar to `eth_getLogs` but more powerful, provides the ability to filter transactions in a single API call.

It builds on the Geth client, any geth node can switch to SubQuery Data Node by replacing the geth binary to data node's.

Working together, the SubQuery Indexer and SubQuery Data Node will provide the most performant indexing performance possible and in a completely decentralised way thanks to the SubQuery Network. Our node runners will be able to run these data nodes on the network, bringing powerful and cost-effective RPC access to all, cementing SubQueryâ€™s position as the fastest decentralised data indexer in web3.

# Compatibility
  The SubQuery Data Node is forked from the Geth client and is compatible with the Ethereum network.
