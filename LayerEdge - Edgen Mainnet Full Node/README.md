# Subquery project LayerEdge - Edgen Mainnet Full Node
####  LayerEdge is a global verification engine that transforms Bitcoin into the security foundation of the internet.

As a cutting-edge Cosmos EVM chain, it plays a key role in our mission to empower decentralized data indexing across multiple ecosystems!

To accelerate adoption, 500,000 SQT tokens will be allocated to boost indexing rewards for node operators supporting LayerEdge. This is a fantastic opportunity for our community to participate in a growing network while earning additional incentives.

We encourage all node operators to deploy a LayerEdge node and help decentralize its infrastructure. By running a validator, youâ€™ll contribute to the networkâ€™s security and efficiency while benefiting from boosted rewards.
